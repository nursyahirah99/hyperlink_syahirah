When it comes to spectacle, few can top Alessandro Michele.This season, the Gucci designer peeled back the curtains on the backstage scene, offering his audience a surreal window into the models’ dressing stations and their hair and makeup process. The one of a kind show was enhanced by a star-studded front row populated by celebrities from around the globe. There was the glamorous Thai actress Davikah Hoorne; Grown-ish star and Harvard student, Yara Shahidi; and, of course, Michele favorite Dakota Johnson. And yet, the day belonged to K-Pop star, Lee Ji-eun, better known as IU. The 26-year-old singer and actress entered the Gucci Hub with appropriate fanfare, dressed in a pleated pink gown from the brand’s spring collection.
<p>
In a business renowned for its boy bands and girl groups, IU is notably a solo act. Blessed with an angelic voice—a listen to her soulful hit “Through the Night” showcases her talents perfectly—and charisma to spare, she’s become one of South Korea’s most popular celebrities. In the spotlight for over a decade, her persona evolved from pop princess next door to multi-faceted and innovative artist. As likely to headline a Netflix series (in 2019 she lead the artsy anthology, Persona) as she is to drop a single, IU proves that being an idol is about much more than music.

<p>
Naturally, fashion giants like Gucci have fallen for her. A newly-minted Michele muse, IU looked right at home alongside the Milan Fashion Week regulars. It takes skill to pull off Michele’s stylized creations, but she’s proven herself adept at transforming runway styles to suit her tastes. Spotted at Seoul’s Incheon Airport earlier this week in a sweeping tartan cape and turtleneck combo, she gave the dramatic piece a touch of real-world charm. Likewise, today’s ethereal look also received an update thanks to the addition of a bedazzled butterfly choker—an adorable accessory for a charming new front-row star.</p>
